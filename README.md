A automated url searcher to couple wit subdomain scanners, vuln scanners(nikto) when there's toomutch to search.

STEPS:
1. save python script to PC
2. perform you're subdomain/vuln scan or any other thing that gather loads of urls.
3. run the cript( python search.py)


4. in the code( path_with_file ) is the default location for option 2 (change this to a location you preffer). ___IF___ option 1 is taken you may choos a a location. 
{option 1 - to open a full bulk of links, option 2 - to open interesting liks of you're choise.}

5. in (past all urls: ) the interesting urls, and past them ___ONE AT A TIME ___WITH A SPACE SEPPERATING EATCH URL___ and hit enter. ___IF___ if option 1 is taken
you can past a full bulk in the text file.
(or if you're terminal dosen't go nuts with multyline pasting you can past the whole chunk _still_with_spaces_ ___OR___ use option 1.)

6. in  Do you require immediat search ? [y,n] press y to search them in a browser (eg-google) or n to just save them to the file for later.

It's exhaustin copy pasting every interesting url going back and forth ___OR___ or come accros boring stuff and just turn around.
so this will just open it in a buntch of new tabs with a bulk of links, or links you're interested in.
you just have to look through them and close earch tab.

there is a repeat option if you've got a bulk of urls and can't finish it at one blow, (Do yo want to repeat ? [y,n] --- press y for yes)
(ammount of urls you past is you're disire, I feel goo with 15 per round in option 2 ___IN___ option 1 it's you're dicition.)

I code theas for fun/making life easier, have fun and make you're own too.
