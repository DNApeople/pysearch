# pysearch
A automated url searcher to couple wit subdomain scanners, vuln scanners(nikto) when there's toomutch to search.

STEPS:
1. save python script to PC
2. perform you're subdomain/vuln scan or any other thing that gather loads of urls.
3. run the cript( python search.py)
4. in the code change file path( path_with_file ) to a disired location.
5. in (past all urls: ) the interesting urls, and past them ___ONE AT A TIME ___WITH A SPACE SEPPERATING EATCH URL___ and hit enter.
(or if you're terminal dosen't go nuts with multyline pasting you can past the whole chunk _still_with_spaces_.)
6. in  Do you require immediat search ? [y,n] press y to search them in a browser (eg-google) or n to just save them to the file.

It's exhaustin copy pasting every interesting url going back and forth.
so this will just open it in a buntch of new tabs,
you just have to look through them and close earch tab. (ammount of urls you past is you're disire, I fell go with 15 per round)

I code theas for fun/making life easier, have fun and make you're own.
